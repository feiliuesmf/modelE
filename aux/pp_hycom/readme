(1) avg:
 --- get key monthly mean variables in mon_[runid]_[decade].txt
 --- get key annual  mean variables in ann_[runid]_[decade].txt
 --- get MOC in lat/rho space in 4 basins averaged over year ny1:ny2  
     in avg_ov_[runid]_[decade].txt: flux(idm,kdm,4)
 --- get northward heatflux as a function of lat in "heatfl(idm,4)"
     in 4 basins averaged over year ny1:ny2 in avg_hf_[runid]_[decade].txt

(2) pltov_mon: instead of annual or multi-year mean in (1), flux and
    heatfl here are calculated on the monthly base.

(3) latlonz: convert monthly hycom output from native grid to
          1x1 deg lat/lon grid and 33 levels; annual z-output field are
          generated by averaging 12 monthly z-data. 

    Currently cpler.z_rho is used to interpolate data in the vertical 
    direction first and then in the horizontal direction later. 
    Alternatively cpler.rho_z can be used to interpolate data in the 
    horizontal first, vertical later fashion. 

(4) get2d: read monthly output from "latlonz" and generate 2d fields 
           of ij,ik,jk section. 

Note: one needs to add the name of runid, starting/ending year 
and if multi-year monthly mean is required before conversion
in "input" and run it under the dir where the data are. The location
of the data on the native grid is in "path1" in const_proc.f, and 
is set to be the current directory by default. Also make sure the 
number of tracer "ntrcr" in hycom_dimen.f is consistent with that 
in the dataset. 

To run the code:

$ make avg
$ avg <input

$ make pltov_mon
$ pltov_mon <input

$ make latlonz
$ latlonz <input

$ make get2d
$ get2d <input

c**** sdata needs to be changed in calling program.
c**** soils44b 8/25/93
c**** uses snow conductivity of .088 w m-1 c-1 instead of .3d0
c**** soils44 8/16/93
c**** adds bedrock for heat calculations, to fill out the
c**** number of layers to ngm.
c**** soils43 6/25/93

c**** removes snow from canopy and places it on vegetated soil.
c**** soils39 4/19/93
c**** modifications for real*8 or real*4 runs.  common block

c**** soils32 7/15/92
c**** 1) for purposes of infiltration only, reduces soil conductivity
c**** by (1-thetr*fice) instead of (1-fice).
c**** 2) betad is reduced by fraction of ice in each layer.
c**** 3) transpired water is removed by betad fraction in each layer,
c**** instead of by fraction of roots. prevents negative runoff.
c**** 4) speeds up hydra by using do loop instead of if check,

c**** depth, thus fixing non-conservation of water.

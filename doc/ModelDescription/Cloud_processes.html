<H3>Cloud processes</H3>

<P>CONDSE is a driver that sets up the vertical arrays for the column
models for moist convection and large scale condensation, and
accumulates diagnostics and output for the radiation and other
modules.</P>

<H4>Moist convection</H4>
<P>The moist convection routine is a plume based model (Yao and Del
Genio, 1995) that incorporates entraining and non-entraining plumes,
downdrafts (which can also entrain environmental air), subsidence
(using the quadratic upstream scheme).  
</P>

<H4>Large scale condensation</H4>
<P>The main cloud generating  routine LSCOND is based on Del Genio et
al 1996, with some modifications to improve the simulation of the
nucleation of super-cooled precipitation and the estimate of
near-surface cloud formation in very shallow pbl conditions.</P>

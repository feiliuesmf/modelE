<p> The soils are modelled separately for bare and vegetated
soil. Additionally, there is a canopy layer over the vegetated
portion. The soils are modelled using 6 variable depth
layers. Evapotransiration takes water from the surface pools, and from
below as a function of rooting depths. Runoff is calculated using a
TOPmodel approach.

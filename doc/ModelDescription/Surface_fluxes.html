<H3>Surface fluxes</H3>

<p> Surface fluxes are calculated separately for each land surface
type (open water, ice, earth and land ice). For each type, a different
high resolution PBL calculation is done to extrapolate the first layer
atmospheric properites to the surface (defined as 10m above the
ground). The diffusion parameters in the PBL layers are functions of
the local turbulence closure scheme (Cheng et al, 2002) and are
iterated to get a robust estimate of the surface properties
(temperature, humidity, and tracer concentration) and
fluxes. Generally, 2 or 4 surface flux time steps are done every hour,
depending on the vertical resolution.</p>

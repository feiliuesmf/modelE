<H3>Turbulence and Dry convection</H3>

<p> There are two methods of vertical mixing outside of the surface
layer: Either, complete mixing is performed if two boxes are statically
unstable (using the virtual potential temperature) (DRYCNV), or a
turbulence closure is used to estimate the amount of mixing based on
on the grid-scale properties and available TKE (ATURB). </p>

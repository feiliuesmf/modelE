Major Changes from Model II'
============================

Variable name changes/re-definitions:

  - FDATA replaced with FLAND/FOCEAN/FLICE/FLAKE/FEARTH

  - GDATA replaced with:
    SNOWI,HSI  (sea ice)
    SNOWE,TEARTH,WEARTH,AIEARTH,SNOAGE (earth)
    TLANDI, SNOWLI (land ice)

  - ODATA replaced with: TOCEAN, RSI and MSI (TLAKE over land)

  - Second order moments are condensed to one array. Whether the
    quadratic or linear upstream scheme is required now only requires
    a change in the QUSCOM/QUSDEF modules. Multiple advection routines
    replaced with one general purpose routine.

  - Arrays that are used for column physics only are now written with
    the column index first (i.e. L,I,J) for performance improvement
 
  - Ground temperatures for SURFCE/RADIA and PBL are now saved in the
    GTEMP array.

  - parameters for both the model and all sub modules are now saved in a
    parameter block that is of variable length and self-documenting
    (replacing JC/RC in the old code).

Structural and Fortran 90 related changes

  - Common blocks replaced with physics-related MODULEs

  - Model common block (i.e. BB399xyz.COM) now MODEL_COM MODULE

  - physical constants all defined in CONSTANT module

  - Each physical submodule (ie. ice, snow, ocean, land, land ice,
    clouds,etc.) has it's own fortran MODULE. As far as possible,
    different modules interact only through fluxes.

  - initialisation of each sub-module is now in init_PHYS (if required)

  - daily processes moved into daily_PHYS (if needed)

  - Many errors in diagnostics and in the seaice/Qflux model corrected

  - lakes are seperated from ocean variables/code.

  - sea ice now seperated from ocean/lakes code. All fluxes are now passed.

  - Explicit use of B-grid velocity points is now implicit.

Diagnostics

  - pdE (used to print diagnostics) is now just an alternate entry to
    the model, and thus cannot be out of date.

  - diagnostic arrays now addressed by name, not number

Input/Output

  - Named files in rundeck instead of unit numbers

  - FILEMANAGER module to allocate unit numbers

  - input/output decentralized to io_PHYS routines for each PHYS submodule

Runtime environment

  - compiling/linking/setup now under control of an automatic makefile process

  - NAMELIST input:
      TAUI/E replaced with YEARI/E,MONTHI/E,DATEI/E,HOURI/E (alt. IHOURE)
      NDPRNT/NDZERO replaced with NIPRNT and NMONAV
      DT related variables such as NRAD etc, now relate to DTsrc
      (=1hour)
      SIGE setting replaced with PLTOP (pressure at the top of
      the level) - SIGE is now computed.
      U00 replaced with U00wtr and U00ice (separate numbers for
      ice and water clouds)

  - Local parameters are now stored in the parameter database which mainly 
    supplants the NAMELIST input. 


New physics

  - Sea ice over the ocean is now formed at TFO (=-1.8 deg).

  - Solar radiation now penetrates into (and through) the sea ice.

  - Sea ice salinity is now a prognostic variable (though not yet
    fully coupled to the thermodynamics).

  - lake temperature/ice cover are now predicted using a two layer
    energy/mass conserving model.

  - Turbulence is now applied throughtout the atmosphere (ATURB.f).

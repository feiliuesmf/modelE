Major changes from version modelE-2-0 to modelE-2-0-1
=====================================================

 - Minor fixes to almost all components

 - New options for snow-age definitions, Sea-ice and SST cycling.

 - netcdf output now fully functional

 - Changes to makefiles for compilation using Linux compilers (Absoft
   + Lahey/Fujitsu)

Major changes from version modelE-1-3-3 to modelE-2-0
=====================================================

Atmospheric Model:

 - Advection of Q now done outside dynamics loop

 - New sea ice albedo scheme (pudlling and snowage replaced with
   prognostic melt-pond fraction and wet/dry snow flag).

 - solar radiation penetration through sea ice now wavelength dependent

 - the basal fluxes between the ice and ocean are calculated using a new
   turbulence scheme. New routines UNDERICE, iceocean, icelake.

 - parallelisation directives for atmospheric model

 - changes to boundary layer cloud specifications

 - improvements to turbulence calculations (including a fix of a bug
   that caused problems when the first layer was too thin)

 - fix for mass fluxes over topography to prevent unrealistic
   precipitation hotspots

 - Multiple vertical resolutions available

 - new interface for radiation to allow more control of greenhouse
   gases, aerosols etc. from rundeck.

 - Adjustable input of CH4 related stratospheric water vapour

 - Numerous parameters for the gravity wave drag  adjustable from the rundeck 

Coupled Model:

 - Gary's ocean model now fully coupled (plug and play option)

 - Ice dynamics now a completey separate module

 - Ocean heat transport diagnostic in printout

 - much more extensive ocean diagnostics

Tracer code:

 - tracer code for air mass and water mass tracers (uses preprocessing
   directives set from the run deck)

 - wet/dry deposition code for general tracers (aerosols, particles,
   water and soluble gases)

 - multiple example tracers pre-coded

Diagnostics: 

 - Numerous errors in diagnostic printout fixed

 - Re-arrangement of budget pages to provide more relevant info.

 - Conservation diagnostics for AM and KE actually add up.

 - Configurable daily and sub-daily diagnsotic output for selected quantities

Run Envrionment:

 - .modelErc file in home directory to enable a configuration to set
   up a local distribution on any machine

 - automatic compilation of online documentation for any particular
   configuration. 

 - new 'lock' file method for preventing un-intended writing over of files.

 - MUST USE COMMANDS 'runE' and 'sswE' to start and stop model

 - automatic re-starting with smaller timestep for some crashes (set from 
   initial rundeck)

Major Changes from Model II' to modelE-1-3-3
============================================

Variable name changes/re-definitions:

  - FDATA replaced with FLAND/FOCEAN/FLICE/FLAKE/FEARTH

  - GDATA replaced with:
    SNOWI,HSI  (sea ice)
    SNOWE,TEARTH,WEARTH,AIEARTH,SNOAGE (earth)
    TLANDI, SNOWLI (land ice)

  - ODATA replaced with: TOCEAN, RSI and MSI (TLAKE over land)

  - Second order moments are condensed to one array. Whether the
    quadratic or linear upstream scheme is required now only requires
    a change in the QUSCOM/QUSDEF modules. Multiple advection routines
    replaced with one general purpose routine.

  - Arrays that are used for column physics only are now written with
    the column index first (i.e. L,I,J) for performance improvement
 
  - Ground temperatures for SURFCE/RADIA and PBL are now saved in the
    GTEMP array.

  - parameters for both the model and all sub modules are now saved in a
    parameter block that is of variable length and self-documenting
    (replacing JC/RC in the old code).

Structural and Fortran 90 related changes

  - Common blocks replaced with physics-related MODULEs

  - Model common block (i.e. BB399xyz.COM) now MODEL_COM MODULE

  - physical constants all defined in CONSTANT module

  - Each physical submodule (ie. ice, snow, ocean, land, land ice,
    clouds,etc.) has it's own fortran MODULE. As far as possible,
    different modules interact only through fluxes.

  - initialisation of each sub-module is now in init_PHYS (if required)

  - daily processes moved into daily_PHYS (if needed)

  - Many errors in diagnostics and in the seaice/Qflux model corrected

  - lakes are seperated from ocean variables/code.

  - sea ice now seperated from ocean/lakes code. All fluxes are now passed.

  - Explicit use of B-grid velocity points is now implicit.

Diagnostics

  - pdE (used to print diagnostics) is now just an alternate entry to
    the model, and thus cannot be out of date.

  - diagnostic arrays now addressed by name, not number

Input/Output

  - Named files in rundeck instead of unit numbers

  - FILEMANAGER module to allocate unit numbers

  - input/output decentralized to io_PHYS routines for each PHYS submodule

Runtime environment

  - compiling/linking/setup now under control of an automatic makefile process

  - NAMELIST input:
      TAUI/E replaced with YEARI/E,MONTHI/E,DATEI/E,HOURI/E (alt. IHOURE)
      NDPRNT/NDZERO replaced with NIPRNT and NMONAV
      DT related variables such as NRAD etc, now relate to DTsrc
      (=1hour)
      SIGE setting replaced with PLTOP (pressure at the top of
      the level) - SIGE is now computed.
      U00 replaced with U00wtr and U00ice (separate numbers for
      ice and water clouds)

  - Local parameters are now stored in the parameter database which mainly 
    supplants the NAMELIST input. 


New physics

  - Sea ice over the ocean is now formed at TFO (=-1.8 deg).

  - Solar radiation now penetrates into (and through) the sea ice.

  - Sea ice salinity is now a prognostic variable (though not yet
    fully coupled to the thermodynamics).

  - lake temperature/ice cover are now predicted using a two layer
    energy/mass conserving model.

  - Turbulence can now be applied throughtout the atmosphere (ATURB.f).

Major Changes from Model II'
============================

- FDATA replaced with FLAND/FOCEAN/FLICE/FLAKE/FEARTH

- GDATA replaced with:
   SNOWI,TSI  (sea ice)
   SNOWE,TEARTH,WEARTH,AIEARTH,SNOAGE (earth)
   TLANDI, SNOWLI (land ice)

- ODATA replaced with: TOCEAN, RSI and MSI (TLAKE over land)

- Named files in rundeck instead of unit numbers

- FILEMANAGER module to allocate unit numbers

- physical constants all defined in CONSTANT module

- Common blocks repalced with physics-related MODULEs

- Model COMMON BLOCK now E001M12_COM MODULE

- Each physical submodule (ie. ice, snow, ocean, land, land ice,
  clouds,etc.) has it's own fortran MODULE. As far as possible,
  different modules interact only through fluxes.  

- input/output decentralized to io_PHYS routines for each PHYS submodule

- initialisation of each sub-module is now in init_PHYS (if required)
- daily processes moved into daily_PHYS (if needed)

- diagnostic arrays now addressed by name, not number

- compiling/linking/setup now under control of an automatic makefile process

- NAMELIST input:
	   TAU replaced with IYEAR,IDAY,IHOUR
	   NDPRNT/NDZERO replaced with NIPRNT and NMONAV
	   DT related varaibles such as NRAD etc, now relate to DTsrc
	   (=1hour)
	   SIGE setting replaced with PLTOP (pressure at the top of
	   the level) - SIGE is now computed.
	   U00 replaced with U00wtr and U00ice (seperate numbers for
	   ice and water clouds)

- Many errors in diagnostics and in the seaice/Qflux model corrected

- Arrays that are used for column physics only are now written with
  the column index first (i.e. L,I,J) for performance improvement

- Second order moments are condensed to one array. Whether the
  quadratic or linear upstream scheme is required now only requires
  a change in the QUSCOM/QUSDEF modules. Multiple advection routines
  replaced with one general purpose routines.

- lakes are seperated from ocean variables/code.

- Explicit use of B-grid velocity points is now implicit.

- sea ice now seperated from ocean/lakes code. All fluxes are now passed.

- Ground temperatures for SURFCE/RADIA and PBL are now saved in the
  GTEMP array.

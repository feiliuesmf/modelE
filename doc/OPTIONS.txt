Options for running the GISS GCM
================================

There are a number of 'plug and play' options available for ModelE,
and there will be more soon. The essence of this is that by a simple
change of filename in the rundeck, a new model will be compiled and
run, without any further coding necessary. (A good thing!).  Remember
that you must recompile the model and replace the executable for any
change to be effected. (i.e. 'gmake exe RUN=E001xyz')

This is a brief list of the current options:

0) Resolution (horizontal and vertical)

RES_M12: 4x5 (medium resolution) 12 vertical layers 
RES_M23: 4x5 (medium resolution) 23 vertical layers (incl. stratosphere)

Other resolutions can be used as required. Note that these files also
contain some dummy routines that can be replaced by other options (see
v) below).

i) Momentum advection scheme:

MOMEN2ND:  2nd order advection scheme (12 layer DT = 450 sec)
MOMEN4TH:  4th order advection scheme (12 layer DT = 300 sec)


ii) Binary output from postprocessing

POUT: Standard GISS output 
	ij arrays: TITLE*80,DATA(IM,JM)*R4,ZMEAN(JM)*R4,GLOB*R4
	jl/jk arrays: TITLE*80,IX,IY,IZ,IT,X(IX,IY,IZ,IT),XCOOR(IX),
                      YCOOR(IY),ZCORR(IZ),TCORR(IT),CX,CY,CZ,CT,'NASAGISS',
                      ASUM(IX),GLOB,ZMEAN(IZ) 
	j arrays: (ASCII) aplot format 

POUT_netcdf: Full netcdf format for all fields

Other output methods may also be defined.

iii) Ocean model treatment

The ocean treatment is set in a couple of ways. For the basic
(no-dynamics) ocean, there are three options: a) fixed SST, b) Mixed
layer ocean (with fixed ocean heat transports, and c) Mixed layer
ocean with fixed transports and deep diffusion into the top 1000m).
The fixed SST run is set by using KOCEAN = 0 in the rundeck, while the
Qflux ocean is set by KOCEAN = 1. Whether this gives the simple mixed
layeer ocean or the deep diffusing ocean, depends on the following
'plug and play' options:

OCEAN OCNML :  fixed SST ocean or simple Qlfux 

OCEAN ODEEP :  fixed SST ocean or deep diffusing Qflux 

The fixed SST ocean requires the following files: OSST, SICE, OCNML, MLMAX
The Qflux ocean requires in addition: OHT 
The deep diffusion Qflux model also requires: EDDY and TG3M

For dynamic oceans, the only current option is to use  

ODIAG_COM OCEAN_COM OSTRAITS_COM OGEOM }
OCNDYN OSTRAITS OCNGM OCNKPP OCNFUNTAB } - Russell Dynamic Ocean
ICEDYN                                 }

In time, other ocean models will also be incorporated.

iv) Atmospheric mixing

DRYCNV: original scheme. complete mixing of dry statically unstable column.

ATURB: turbulence scheme that diffuses tracers as a function of second
       order colsure calulations of effective diffusivity.

v) Stratospheric diagnostics

STRAT_DIAG: calculates full set of zonally averaged EP-fluxes. Must be
            used in conjunction with a suitable RES_Xnn file. 
            (i.e. one that does not have dummy routines EP*, and sets
            KEP to be non-zero).

vi) Stratosphere dynamics (Gravity wave drag)

STRATDYN: Calculates and applies gravity wave drag in the
          dynamics. This MUST be used for all strat models, but can
          also be used for tropospheric models. Note that a suitable
          RES_Xnn file must be used in conjunction. (i.e. One that
          does not have a dummy GWDRAG, VDIFF or io_strat).

vii) Fast fourier transforms

FFT72: Suitable for IM=72 models
FFT144: Suiable for IM=144 models

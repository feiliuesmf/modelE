# This file contains global options for modelE. By default they are
# adjusted to the working environment of Ra.giss.nasa.gov .

## Directory structure ##

# DECKS_REPOSITORY - a directory for permanenet storage of run info.
# All rundecks that you create will be copied to this directory. 
DECKS_REPOSITORY=/u/cmrun/modelE/decks

# CMRUNDIR - directory to which all run directories will be linked.
# This directory will be searched by most scripts for locations of 
# specific runs.
CMRUNDIR=/u/cmrun

# GCMSEARCHPATH - directory to search for gcm input files.
# All necessary input files should be copied or linked to this directory.
GCMSEARCHPATH=/u/cmrun

# EXECDIR - path to directory with modelE scripts and with some
# executables. This directory should contain the scripts from modelE/exec.
EXECDIR=/u/exec

# NETCDFHOME - path to location of netcdf library. Leave blank if netcdf
# is not installed on this computer
NETCDFHOME=/usr/local/netcdf-3.4/lib64

# SAVEDISK - a directory where all run directories (which will contain
# all output files such as rsf, acc etc.) will be created. This should
# be big enough to accomodate all model output.
SAVEDISK=/raid1

## Customizable setings for Makefile ##

# MAILTO - email address of the user. When the program ends/crashes
# all notifications will be sent to this address. If not specified
# `whoami` will be used.

# OVERWRITE - can "gmake rundeck" overwrite files already in repository?
# (i.e. in the directory DECKS_REPOSITORY)
OVERWRITE=NO

# OUTPUT_TO_FILES - if set to YES all errors and warnings will be sent
# to files with the names <source_name>.ERR
OUTPUT_TO_FILES=YES

# VERBOSE_OUTPUT - if set to YES gmake will show compilation commands
# and some other information. Otherwise most of the output will be
# suppressed
VERBOSE_OUTPUT=NO

# MP - multiprocessing support. If set to YES gmake will compile the 
# code with OpenMP instructions. This option has effect only on SGI.
MP=NO

# UMASK - the value of 'umask' you want to use for model runs. The files
# inside the run directory will have permissions set according to this
# mask.
UMASK=002

# COMPILER - this option has effect only on Linux machines. It specifies

The directory tree of the modelE has the following structure:

  modelE
        |
        |-/model   (the source code for GCM model)
        |
        |-/aux     (auxiliary programs such as pre- and post-processing)
        |
        |-/prtdag  (source code for diagnostic postprocessing)
        |
        |-/exec    (various scripts needed to compile and setup the model)
        |
        |-/doc     (directory for documentation)
        |
        |-/decks   (directory for rundecks)
                |
                |-<run_name_1>.R     (rundeck for the run <run_name_1>)
                |
                |-/<run_name_1>_bin  (directory for binaries for <run_name_1>)
                |
                |-/<run_name_1>      (link to directory where you setup
                |                     and run <run_name_1>)
                |-<run_name_2>.R
                ................


               Compiling and running the model.

   Intended working directory is directory /decks. All rundecks should
be created inside this directory and all "make" commands should be run
from there. The following is a typical example of how to compile and
setup a run with the name "my_run":

      cd decks                      # go to directory decks
      gmake rundeck RUN=my_run      # create rundeck for "my_run"
      gmake gcm RUN=my_run          # compile the model for "my_run"
      gmake setup RUN=my_run        # run setup script for "my_run"

Make sure that you create the rundeck with "gmake mkrun ..." before
running any other commands for this run, otherwise the Makefile will
not understand you. You can skip "gmake gcm ..." and just do "gmake setup..."
in which case gcm will be compiled automatically.
Another command you want to run (after creating the rundeck) is:

      gmake aux RUN=my_run

This will compile auxiliary programs in /aux. All the binaries (both for
model and for auxiliary programs) are put into /decks/my_run.bin .

The following is a list of targets currently supported by Makefile:

 rundeck - create new rundeck
 depend  - create dependencies for specified rundeck
 gcm     - compile object files and build executable for specified rundeck
 aux     - compile auxiliary programs
 setup   - do setup for specified rundeck
 clean   - remove listings and error files
 vclean  - remove object files, .mod files and dependencies
 newstart - remove all files in the run directory
 mkexe   - compile gcm and put executable into RUN directory

If you run "gmake" without arguments it will print a short help.
